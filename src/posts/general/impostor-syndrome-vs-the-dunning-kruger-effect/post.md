Impostor syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect are two common psychological problems which haunt many in the dev community and beyond. Since these have been explored in-depth by a huge number of insightful people, here's my conclusion in a nutshell:

> To find the sweet spot between impostor syndrome and overconfidence, you need to understand that you can be wrong without it reflecting on your competence.

That's it.

Confused? Skeptical?

Fine, I'll explain.

First, what do we mean by **"impostor syndrome"**?

It's a state of mind in which people doubt their own skills, downplay their accomplishments, and experience fear of being exposed as an impostor who doesn't really know what they're talking about.

People experiencing impostor syndrome attribute their success to luck, or deception, or some other external factor which is outside of their control. They feel this way no matter how much evidence there is to the contrary - no matter how much their peers value them and their work - and as a result they feel anxiety, stress, or depression.

Second, what is **the Dunning-Kruger effect**?

In a word: overconfidence. It is a cognitive bias which leads people to believe they are more competent than they are, due to inability to objectively evaluate oneself.

People experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect are unable to recognise that they are not performing to the standards they think they are. It mostly occurs in situations where expertise can only be percieved by an expert - until someone reaches a high level of understanding, they risk incorrectly believing they have already reached those heights of understanding.

I've always felt that these two problems can be seen as extreme ends of a wide spectrum - after all, they both stem from the fact that self-assessment is difficult. They're both exacerbated by the pace of change in our industry, by the often unrealistic shared narratives of our community, and by the simple fact of how ephemeral our work can be.

The problem with a lot of the discussion around these issues is that it usually looks at just one of the extremes in isolation, and the advice is given through that lens. The advice might work for many, but for others it can result in a painful cycle where they yo-yo from one extreme to the other.

It's like the classic mind trick of giving an impossible command - "don't think of an elephant". The targets to aim for aren't always clear. How much confidence is too much? What level of self-doubt is the right amount?

Instead, we need some balance.

The way out of this catch-22 is to clearly define what the middle ground is, what mindset people should aim for which will help them avoid both extremes.

And so, we have returned to our conclusion:

> To find the sweet spot between impostor syndrome and overconfidence, you need to understand that you can be wrong without it reflecting on your competence.
